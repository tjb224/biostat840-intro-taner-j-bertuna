I previously received a BA in Government with a focus on international relations from Cornell University. While in undergrad, I competed on the Cornell University Sailing Team from 2012 to 2016.\nI am interested in infectious disease modelling and its applications in the fight against vaccine preventable diseases. I am specifically interested in researching influenza viruses and their pandemic potential.\nI am currently working for the JHU Department of Epidemiology on a COVID-19, Cholera, and Hepatitis E serologic survey of Chittagong Bangladesh. This work is associated with my masters thesis, focused on exploring Cholera related healthcare seeking in the study cohort. I also work at the JHU’s International Vaccine Access Center on several projects related to COVID-19 modeling and COVID-19 vaccine health systems. I have previously volunteered over 200 hrs in clinical settings, interned at the WHO, and worked in project management on the construction of a 50 story skyscraper."

Looking at sex, table 1 indicates that males have a larger average body mass as compared to females, across all three species’. This is supported by a simple uni variate linear regression that indicates that males weight about 4.5 lbs more than females (this association is statistically significant with a p value of < 0.000). Looking at flipper length, table 2 indicates that there is a clear positive association between length and body mass for all three species and that the association is more pronounced for Gentoo penguins. Finally, table 3 shows that the only penguin species found across all three islands (Adelie penguins) do not vary in weight across the islands, indicating that island verity does not effect average weight for the species in question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLibraries used: ggplot2, tidyverse, RefManageR, bibtex, and palmerspenguins\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\n“Create Elegant Data Visualisations Using the Grammar of Graphics.” n.d.
